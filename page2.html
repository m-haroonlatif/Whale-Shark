<h1 id="h04">Habitat:</h1>
<p id="p02">The whale shark inhabits all <strong>tropical and warm-temperate seas</strong>. The fish is primarily <strong>pelagic</strong>, 
living in the open sea but not in the greater depths 
of the ocean, although it is known to occasionally dive to depths of as much as <em>1,800 <abbr title="metres">m</abbr> (5,900 <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr>)</em>. 
On <em>7 February 2012</em>, a large whale shark was found floating 150 <abbr title="Kilometres">Km</abbr> (93 <abbr title="Miles">mi</abbr>) off the coast of <strong>Karachi, Pakistan</strong>. 
The length of the specimen was said to be between <em>11 and 12 <abbr title="metres">m</abbr> (36 and 39 <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr>), 
with a weight of around 15,000 <abbr title="Kilograms">kg</abbr> (33,000 <abbr title="Pounds">lb</abbr>)</em>
</p>
<h1 id="h05">Reproduction:</h1>
<p id="p03"><strong>Pupping</strong> of whale sharks has <strong>not</strong> been observed, but <strong>mating</strong> has been witnessed twice in 
<abbr title="Saint">St</abbr> Helena. Mating in this species was <em>filmed for the first time in whale sharks off Ningaloo Reef via airplane in Australia in 2019, 
when a larger male unsuccessfully attempted to mate with a smaller, immature female</em>.
