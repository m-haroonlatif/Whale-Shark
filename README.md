<h1 id="h01"> A brief introduction</h1>


<p id="p01" style="text-align:left:">The <strong>whale shark</strong> is a slow-moving, <i>filter-feeding</i> carpet shark and the <mark>largest</mark> known extant fish species. 
The largest confirmed individual had a length of 18.8 <abbr title=metres>m</abbr> (62 <abbr title=feet>ft</abbr>). The whale shark holds many records for <em>size</em> in the animal kingdom, 
most notably being by far the largest living <i>nonmammalian vertebrate</i>

The whale shark is found in open waters of the tropical oceans and is rarely found in water below <strong>21 <abbr title="degree centigrades">°C</abbr> (70 <abbr title="Degree Farenhite">°F</abbr>).</strong> 
Modeling suggests a lifespan of about <strong>70 years</strong>, and while measurements have proven difficult, estimates from field data 
suggest they may live as long as <strong>130 years</strong>. Whale sharks have very large mouths and are <i class=habit>filter feeders</i>
They feed almost exclusively on <i>plankton</i> and <i>small fishes</i>, and pose <b>no threat</b> to humans.</p>
