<p id="p01">The whale shark is a <strong>filter feeder</strong> â€“ one of only three known filter-feeding shark species (along with the <em>basking shark and the megamouth shark</em>). It feeds on <em>plankton including copepods, krill, fish eggs, Christmas Island red crab larvae</em> and small <em>nektonic life, such as small squid or fish</em>. It also feeds on <em>clouds of eggs during mass spawning of fish and corals</em>. The many rows of <strong>vestigial teeth play no role in feeding</strong>. Feeding occurs either by <strong>ram filtration</strong>, in which the animal opens its mouth and swims forward, pushing water and food into the mouth, or by <strong>active suction feeding</strong>, in which the animal opens and closes its mouth, sucking in volumes of water that are then expelled through the gills. In both cases, the <em>filter pads serve to separate food from water</em>. These unique, black sieve-like structures are presumed to be <strong>modified gill rakers</strong>. Food separation in whale sharks is by <em>cross-flow filtration</em>, in which the water travels nearly parallel to the filter pad surface, not perpendicularly through it, before passing to the outside, while denser food particles continue to the back of the throat. This is an extremely efficient filtration method that minimizes fouling of the filter pad surface. Whale sharks have been observed "coughing", presumably to clear a build-up of particles from the filter pads. Whale sharks migrate to feed and possibly to breed.</p>
<h2 id="h03">Estimated feed</h2>
<p id="p02">The whale shark is an <em>active feeder</em>, targeting concentrations of plankton or fish. It is able to ram filter feed or can gulp in a stationary position. This is in contrast to the passive feeding basking shark, which does not pump water. Instead, it swims to force water across its gills.<br>
A juvenile whale shark is estimated to eat <strong>21 <abbr title="kilogrammes">kg</abbr> (46 pounds)</strong> of plankton per day.</p>
