	<h1 id="h01">Interaction With Humans</h1>
	<p id="p01">Despite its size, the whale shark <strong>does not pose any danger to humans.</strong> Whale sharks are docile fish and sometimes allow swimmers to catch a ride, although this practice is discouraged by shark scientists and conservationists because of the disturbance to the sharks. Younger whale sharks are gentle and can play with divers. Underwater photographers such as <strong>Fiona Ayerst</strong> have photographed them swimming close to humans without any danger.</p>
	<h1 id="h02">In Captivity</h1>
	<p>The whale shark is popular in the few public aquariums that keep it, but its large size means that a very large tank is required and it has specialized feeding requirements. Their large size and iconic status have also fueled an opposition to keeping the species in captivity, especially after the early death of some whale sharks in captivity and certain Chinese aquariums keeping the species in relatively small tanks.</p>
